# Upgrading Lyra to `v0.4.0`

Upgrading Lyra is as simple as updating the version in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@lyrasearch/lyra": "0.4.0"
  }
}
```

or by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @lyrasearch/lyra@0.4.0
```

```bash
yarn add @lyrasearch/lyra@0.4.0
```

```bash
pnpm add @lyrasearch/lyra@0.4.0
```

Once you've updated the version, you can start migrating your codebase.
